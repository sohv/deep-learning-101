# Deep Learning 101

An experimental project for running deep learning experiments on a single GPU (e.g. RTX 4070).

## Includes
- Experiments on overfitting, activations, dropout, and gradient flow
- Modular MLP/CNN models
- Visual tools for neuron-level insight

## To run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python experiments/train_overfit_mnist.py
```
